# Yellow Car Bot ðŸš•

An automated bot that monitors Norwegian traffic cameras for yellow cars and posts them to Bluesky with the classic Norwegian phrase "GUL BIL!" (Yellow Car!).

## How It Works

1. **Downloads images** from 814 Norwegian traffic cameras
2. **Detects yellow clusters** using computer vision
3. **Confirms with AI** whether the yellow object is actually a car
4. **Posts to Bluesky** with "GUL BIL!" when a yellow car is found

## Features

- **Fair Processing**: Shuffles camera order to ensure all cameras get processed at different times of day
- **Budget Optimized**: Designed to stay within GitHub Actions' 2000 minutes/month limit
- **Rate Limit Aware**: Gracefully handles API rate limiting
- **Persistent State**: Remembers progress between runs
- **Statistics Tracking**: Monitors detection rates and posting success

## Setup

### 1. Repository Structure
```
your-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ valid_webcam_ids.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ yellow-car-bot.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 2. Required Files

**requirements.txt**:
```txt
requests
python-dotenv
Pillow
atproto
```

**valid_webcam_ids.txt**:
One traffic camera URL per line (814 URLs total). Example:
```
https://webkamera.atlas.vegvesen.no/public/kamera?id=3000063_1
https://webkamera.atlas.vegvesen.no/public/kamera?id=3001004_1
...
```

### 3. GitHub Secrets

Set up these secrets in your repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

- `BSKY_HANDLE`: Your Bluesky handle (e.g., `username.bsky.social`)
- `BSKY_PASSWORD`: Your Bluesky app password (not your main password!)
- `KEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Azure AI token for GPT-4o vision API

### 4. Bluesky App Password

1. Go to Settings â†’ Privacy and Security â†’ App Passwords
2. Create a new app password for this bot
3. Use this password (not your main password) in the `BSKY_PASSWORD` secret

## Configuration

Edit these variables in `src/main.py`:

```python
MAX_RUNTIME_MINUTES = 20  # Max runtime per session
IMAGES_PER_SESSION = 30   # Images to process per session
YELLOW_THRESHOLD = 150    # Yellow detection sensitivity (lower = more sensitive)
MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE = 80     # Minimum yellow pixels to trigger AI check
```

## Schedule

The bot runs **3 times per day**:
- 6:00 AM UTC
- 2:00 PM UTC
- 10:00 PM UTC

**Budget**: ~63 minutes/day, ~1,890 minutes/month (within 2000 limit)

**Coverage**: All 814 cameras processed every 9 days in randomized order

## How the Shuffling Works

1. **First Run**: Shuffles all 814 camera URLs randomly
2. **Subsequent Runs**: Continues from where it left off
3. **Cycle Complete**: When all URLs processed, reshuffles for next cycle
4. **Fair Distribution**: Each camera gets processed at different times across cycles

## Statistics

The bot tracks:
- Total images processed (all-time)
- Yellow clusters detected
- Cars confirmed by AI
- Successful Bluesky posts
- Processing progress through current cycle

## Yellow Detection Algorithm

**Two-stage process**:

1. **Computer Vision Filter**:
    - Scans image pixels for yellow clusters
    - Uses RGB thresholds: R>150, G>150, B<100
    - Requires minimum 80 yellow pixels
    - Samples every 2nd pixel for speed

2. **AI Confirmation**:
    - Only triggered if yellow cluster found
    - Uses GPT-4o Vision to confirm it's actually a car
    - Receives simple "yes/no" response

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Rate limit reached"**:
- Bot automatically stops to preserve GitHub Actions minutes
- Will resume in next scheduled run

**"Shuffle state not found"**:
- Normal on first run
- Bot will create new shuffle and start processing

**"No yellow cluster detected"**:
- Most images won't have yellow cars - this is normal
- Adjust `YELLOW_THRESHOLD` if too sensitive/insensitive

### Logs

Check workflow logs for:
- Processing progress
- Detection statistics
- Error messages
- Session summaries

### Manual Testing

Trigger a manual run:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Yellow Car Bot - Budget Optimized"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## File Descriptions
